1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a Javascript library that is used to help developers build user interfaces. It allows us to use things like components and hooks to make the development process easier. It makes the code look easier and cleaner for other developers as well.

2. Describe component state.

The component state is managed within the component, and it essentially holds a value to begin your function with that can be changed later in your code.

3. Describe props.

Props stands for properties and it used to pass properties from one component to another. It always flows in one direction which is parent to child.

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

A side effect is anything that affects something outside of the function being executed. This would be something like a network request where we are accessing a third party. You sync effects by using the Effect Hook.
